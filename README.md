**Project 1:** For this beginner-level project on **Bike Sales Analysis**, here are the key steps I undertook:

- Removed duplicate entries from the dataset.
- Standardized the Gender column by replacing 'F' with 'Female' and 'M' with 'Male', and similarly updated the Marital Status column by replacing 'M' with 'Married' and 'S' with 'Single'.
- Created a new column named Age Bracket using nested IF statements to categorize the age data.
- Developed various pivot tables for in-depth analysis.
- Designed a dashboard featuring different types of graphs, including bar and line charts.
